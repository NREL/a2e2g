Integrated code for determining market participation of wind energy. 
A2e2g provides a framework to enable wind plants to provide grid services, 
including:
* Day-ahead atmospheric forecasting
* Probablisitc power forecasting (day-ahead)
* Day-ahead market offering
* Day-ahead market simulation
* Short-term atmospheric and power forecasting (for real-time market)
* Real-time offering
* Real-time market simulation and signal generation
* Wind plant real-time control
* Wind plant aerodynamic simlations
